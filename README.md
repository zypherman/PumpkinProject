# PumpkinProject
Project for my Algorithms course. Implemented a Producer Consumer multi-threaded system. 
Assignment was to mimick a pumpkin growing operation. 
Jack thread was in charge of performing many different tasks. 
He was required to pick produced pumpkins as well as deliver them to orders. ALso had to plant new pumpkins if he was running low. 
Order producer fired off orders at random intervals
Pumpkins would grow again after they were picked.
